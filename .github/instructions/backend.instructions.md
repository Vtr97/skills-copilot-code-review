## Backend Guidelines

- All API endpoints must be defined in the `routers` folder.
- Load example database content from the `database.py` file.
- Log detailed error information on the server, and avoid exposing sensitive error details (such as stack traces or internal queries) to the frontend. The frontend must still receive appropriate HTTP status codes and generic, user-friendly error messages so it can handle errors gracefully.
- Ensure all APIs are explained in the documentation.
- Verify changes in the backend are reflected in the frontend (`src/static/**`). If possible breaking changes are found, mention them to the developer.
